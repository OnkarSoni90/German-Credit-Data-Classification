German Credit Data Classification

Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify credit risk (good/bad) using the Statlog German Credit Data dataset. The objective is to predict whether a person poses a good or bad credit risk based on 24 numerical attributes.

Modeling Approach

1. Data Preprocessing and Loading


2. Splitting data into training and test sets


3. Training and evaluating two models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Results

Replace 75.5% and 71.5% with your actual accuracy scores


---

Confusion Matrix Visualization

Used seaborn.heatmap to visualize confusion matrices for both models to evaluate true positives, false positives, etc.


---

Conclusion

Logistic Regression performed slightly better in terms of accuracy.

Future work can include:

Feature scaling

Hyperparameter tuning

Trying advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
